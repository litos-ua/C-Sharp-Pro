                <p class="about_text responsive-block" >
                    I am a passionate Full Stack developer who specializes in building high-quality web applications and websites.
                    My work combines creativity and engineering approaches, which allows me to develop functional, reliable and
                    scalable solutions. On the frontend side, I use ReactJS to create responsive and modern user
                    interfaces. On the backend side, I use .NET technologies, including ASP.NET Core, to build high-performance
                    server solutions.
                    I have extensive experience in integrating client and server parts, as well as working with relational
                    and NoSQL databases.
                    I pay great attention to testing and code quality, applying advanced approaches such as TDD and CI/CD.
                    In addition, I actively use Git and other version control tools for collaborative development and change control.
                    My projects cover various areas, from e-commerce to management systems and business process automation.
                    Confidence in my work is supported by experience in implementing and supporting ready-made solutions
                    that already help clients achieve their goals.

                        <strong>Project 1:</strong> Pizzeria service and remote ordering system.
                        This project is aimed at automating pizza ordering via a web interface.
                        I developed a user-friendly interface using ReactJS, which allows customers to quickly
                        find and order their favorite dishes. On the server side, an order processing system was implemented
                        using ASP.NET Core, including order status management (new, in progress, delivered).
                        The key feature is support for a discount system, integration with payment gateways and
                        customer notifications via email and SMS. An admin panel was implemented to manage the menu, promotions and
                        statistics. Particular attention was paid to performance, which allowed us to serve up to 1000 users
                        simultaneously.
                        In addition, the system supports flexible delivery settings and integration with mapping services
                        to calculate delivery time. The database is built on SQL Server for reliable storage of information
                        about customers, orders and products.

                        <strong>Project 2:</strong> Online store of electrical and electronic goods.
                        This project is a powerful e-commerce solution with support for a wide range of products.
                        The frontend is implemented in ReactJS using Redux for state management. The application is adapted
                        to work on all devices, including mobile and tablets.
                        The backend on ASP.NET Core provides flexible management of products, customers and orders.
                        A special feature of the store is the module of the recommendation system, which analyzes the
                        preferences of users and offers them relevant products.
                        The project supports various payment methods, including cards, e-wallets and installments.
                        The promotion management system allows you to conduct sales and maintain customer loyalty.
                        The database is built on MS SQL Server, which ensures reliability and scalability.

                        <strong>Project 3:</strong> This website is designed to automate the operation of a network of gas stations.
                        The project includes a client part made in ReactJS, which provides users with information about gas stations,
                        prices and promotions.
                        The server part is built on ASP.NET Core and provides fuel logistics management, as well as support for loyalty programs.
                        The project has implemented integration with the fuel accounting system, which allows you to track balances
                        and supplies in real time.
                        The ability to register for vehicle maintenance online through the website was added. A map was developed showing
                        the nearest gas stations with route calculations to them. The administration system allows you to manage data for
                        each station, promotions and analytics.
                        This project demonstrated my ability to solve complex problems, such as synchronizing data in real time
                        and developing interfaces that are convenient for both users and administrators.
